In the second pass, when emitting UTF-8 bytes,\nthe helper function bmp_to_utf8() incorrectly forwards the remaining UTF-16\nsource byte count as the destination buffer capacity to UTF8_putc(). For BMP\ncode points above U+07FF, UTF-8 requires three bytes, but the forwarded\ncapacity can be just two bytes. UTF8_putc() then returns -1, and this negative\nvalue is added to the output length without validation, causing the\nlength to become negative. The subsequent trailing NUL byte is then written\nat a negative offset, causing write outside of heap allocated buffer.\n\nThe vulnerability is reachable via the public PKCS12_get_friendlyname() API\nwhen parsing attacker-controlled PKCS#12 files. While PKCS12_parse() uses a\ndifferent code path that avoids this issue, PKCS12_get_friendlyname() directly\ninvokes the vulnerable function.
